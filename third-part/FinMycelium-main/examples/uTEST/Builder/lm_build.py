"""
Minimal uTEST for LMBuilder (Single Inference)

This script validates the single-shot LM builder for financial event reconstruction.
It uses a synthetic "Ponzi Scheme" (Dutch Tulip Mania) scenario to test the flow.

Workflow:
1. **Setup**: Constructs a `BuildInput` with one `DataSample` and a `UserQueryInput`.
2. **Execution**: Invokes `LMBuilder` via LangGraph.
   - **EventReconstructor Phase**: Generates the complete EventCascade in one shot.
3. **Verification**:
   - Checks if the final `EventCascade` is correctly generated.
   - Prints status and simple validation.

Usage:
    python examples/uTEST/Builder/lm_build.py -c configs/uTEST/builder/lm_builder.yml
