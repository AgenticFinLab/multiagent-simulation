    This class implements the MatchBase interface using regular expressions
    to search for keywords in text content and extract relevant contexts.
    It finds all occurrences of keywords, extracts surrounding context with
    complete paragraphs, and maps positions for standardized output.

    Main features:
    - Case-insensitive keyword matching using regular expressions
    - Context extraction with complete paragraph boundaries preserved
    - Position mapping for paragraphs and content segments
