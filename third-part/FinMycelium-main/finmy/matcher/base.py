"""
Base abstractions for content matching.

- Provides a consistent result structure (`MatchOutput`, `MatchItem`).
- Defines an abstract `MatchBase` to be extended by concrete matchers
  (e.g., LLM-based, rule-based, hybrid).

We support different ways of matchers:
- LLM-based matcher: uses large models to extract semantically relevant content.
- Rule-based matcher: applies manually crafted or predefined rules to match content.
- Hybrid matcher: combines multiple methods for improved accuracy.

Based on the following platforms:
- Haystack: a flexible framework for building search and question-answering pipelines.
- Langchain: a library for building applications that use language models.
- LlamaIndex: a library for building applications that use language models to index and query data.


Implementers should:
- Override `match` to produce raw output and a list of selection dicts.
- Use `run` for end-to-end execution and standardized results.
